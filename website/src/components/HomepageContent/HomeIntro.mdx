AboutCode is a family of FOSS projects to discover, report and manage metadata
about software:

- Where does the software come from?
- What is its license? its copyright?
- What are its dependencies?
- Was the software well maintained?
- Are there security vulnerabilities?
- Are there licensing issues?

These are all important questions because there are millions of free and open
source software components available on the web for reuse.

Knowing where a software package comes from, what its license is and whether
it is vulnerable should be a problem of the past such that everyone can safely
consume more free and open source software. We support not only open source
software, but also open data, generated and curated by our applications.
