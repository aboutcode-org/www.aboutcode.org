# Getting Started

Welcome to AboutCode! This guide will help you get started with our tools and projects.

AboutCode is a family of open source projects and open data designed to help you discover, identify, and manage the software you use. Whether you are a developer, a compliance officer, or a security researcher, our tools provide the metadata and analysis needed to understand your software supply chain.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to make open source easier and safer to use by building critical tools for Software Composition Analysis (SCA) and beyond. We believe that good open source tools and open data help everyone consume more free and open source software safely and efficiently.
